# Real-Time Head Pose Estimation and Gaze Detection

## Overview

This research explores a novel approach to real-time head pose estimation and gaze detection using computer vision techniques. The project leverages the Mediapipe framework and OpenCV to process video streams from a webcam, detecting facial landmarks and inferring the orientation of the head and the direction of gaze. 

## Key Features

- **3D Head Pose Estimation**: Utilizes the solvePnP algorithm to estimate the 3D head pose.
- **Gaze Detection**: Projects gaze vectors onto a 3D model of the face to determine the direction of gaze.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Converts facial landmarks into a 3D model using the Mediapipe framework.
- **Camera Calibration**: Applies camera calibration techniques to improve accuracy.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Provides real-time feedback on the user's gaze direction relative to the screen.

## Methodology

1. **Facial Landmark Detection**: Detects facial landmarks using the Mediapipe framework.
2. **3D Model Conversion**: Converts detected landmarks into a 3D model.
3. **Camera Calibration**: Calibrates the camera for accurate head pose estimation.
4. **Head Pose Estimation**: Uses the solvePnP algorithm to estimate 3D head pose vectors.
5. **Gaze Detection**: Adjusts head pose vectors based on gaze scores and projects gaze direction onto a 3D model.
6. **Visualization**: Visualizes results in real-time, providing feedback on gaze direction.

## Technologies Used

- **Mediapipe**: Framework for detecting and tracking facial landmarks.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.

## Applications

- **Human-Computer Interaction**: Enhances interaction by understanding user gaze direction.
- **Virtual Reality**: Improves VR experiences by accurately tracking head pose and gaze.
- **Driver Monitoring Systems**: Monitors driver attention and alertness.

## Future Work

- **Accuracy and Robustness**: Improve the accuracy and robustness of head pose and gaze detection.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrate machine learning models for better landmark detection.
- **Diverse Environments**: Explore applications in various environments such as virtual reality and driver monitoring systems.
